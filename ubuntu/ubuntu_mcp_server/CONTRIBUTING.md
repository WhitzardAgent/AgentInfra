# Contributing to Secure Ubuntu MCP Server

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the Secure Ubuntu MCP Server! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Our mission is to provide a **security-first**, production-ready MCP server that enables AI assistants to safely interact with Ubuntu systems. Every contribution should align with these core principles:

1. **Security First** - Security is never optional or "nice to have"
2. **Fail Safe** - Default to restrictive permissions and explicit allowlists
3. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers with comprehensive validation
4. **Transparency** - Clear audit trails and understandable error messages
5. **Production Ready** - Code quality suitable for production environments

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 18.04+ (primary development environment)
- Python 3.9+
- Git
- Basic knowledge of system security principles

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-ubuntu-mcp.git
   cd secure-ubuntu-mcp
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If we add dev dependencies
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   python main.py --test
   python main.py --security-test
   ```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes  
- `security/description` - Security improvements
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed description if needed

- Breaking changes noted with BREAKING CHANGE:
- References to issues: Fixes #123
```

Examples:
- `feat(security): add symlink resolution validation`
- `fix(commands): prevent shell injection in apt commands`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests and pass existing test suites.

### Required Tests

1. **Functionality Tests**
   ```bash
   python main.py --test
   ```

2. **Security Tests**
   ```bash
   python main.py --security-test
   ```

3. **Custom Tests**
   Add tests for new functionality in the appropriate test functions.

### Test Coverage
- New functions must have corresponding tests
- Security-related code requires negative testing (verify attacks are blocked)
- Edge cases and error conditions must be tested

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Security Review Process
All security-related changes require:
1. Threat modeling for new features
2. Security test cases demonstrating protection
3. Documentation of security implications
4. Code review by maintainers

### Security Principles

**Path Validation**:
- Always resolve symlinks before path checks
- Use allowlists over denylists when possible
- Validate against canonical paths
- Handle edge cases (empty paths, special characters, etc.)

**Command Execution**:
- Never use shell=True in subprocess calls
- Use shlex.split() for command parsing
- Validate commands against allowlists
- Sanitize all user inputs

**Resource Protection**:
- Implement timeouts for all operations
- Limit file sizes, output sizes, and directory listings
- Prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- Monitor resource usage

### Common Security Pitfalls

❌ **Don't do this**:
```python
# Direct path concatenation
path = base_path + "/" + user_input

# Shell execution with user input  
os.system(f"ls {user_path}")

# Trusting user input
if user_path.startswith("/safe/"):
    allow_access()
```

✅ **Do this instead**:
```python
# Safe path joining with validation
path = security_checker.validate_path_access(
    os.path.join(base_path, user_input)
)

# Safe command execution
subprocess.run(["ls", validated_path], ...)

# Canonical path checking
canonical_path = resolve_path_safely(user_path)
if canonical_path.startswith(safe_canonical_path):
    allow_access()
```

## 📝 Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all public functions
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Documentation
- All public functions must have docstrings
- Include parameter types and descriptions
- Document security implications for security-related code
- Add usage examples for complex functions

### Error Handling
- Use specific exception types
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log security violations appropriately
- Never expose internal paths or system details in error messages

## 🎨 Code Architecture

### Modular Design
The codebase follows a clear separation of concerns:

```
SecurityPolicy     - Configuration and policy definitions
SecurityChecker    - Path validation and command verification  
AuditLogger       - Security event logging
SecureUbuntuController - Main business logic with security integration
FastMCP Tools     - MCP protocol interface layer
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Security Policy Updates**
   ```python
   # Add new configuration options to SecurityPolicy
   @dataclass
   class SecurityPolicy:
       # ... existing fields
       new_security_option: bool = False
   ```

2. **Security Validation**
   ```python
   # Add validation logic to SecurityChecker
   def validate_new_operation(self, params: str) -> str:
       # Implement security checks
       pass
   ```

3. **Controller Implementation**
   ```python
   # Add business logic to SecureUbuntuController
   def new_operation(self, params: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       validated_params = self.security_checker.validate_new_operation(params)
       # Implementation
       self.audit_logger.log_operation("NEW_OP", params, self.current_user, True)
   ```

4. **MCP Tool Interface**
   ```python
   # Add MCP tool in create_ubuntu_mcp_server
   @mcp.tool("new_operation")
   async def new_operation(params: str) -> str:
       try:
           result = controller.new_operation(params)
           return json.dumps(result, indent=2)
       except Exception as e:
           return format_error(e)
   ```
